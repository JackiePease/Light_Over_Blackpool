# Jupyter Notebook to generate Sierpinski triangle pattern

Created with @goatchurch

The laser cutter used by the company cutting the triangles, Atlas Plastics in Leigh, uses black and white jpeg files rather than vector graphic files. I produced a black and white version of the svg and emailed it to them. They were then able to import it into Illustrator and export as a jpeg.
